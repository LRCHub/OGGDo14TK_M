Silent night, trough closed eyes I see,
Into the future and beyond my dreams,
Piles of corpses all dead by my hand,
I'm the king of horrors and this is my land,

Do you know who I am?
IM THE KING!
And I don't mean Elvis!

Psycho, psycho, psycho - Voices in my head,
Psycho, psycho, psycho - I wanna see you dead,

Inside of my brain, It's my scapes you walk,
I can smell your fear, you which I stalk,
The moon is shining for you and me,
I'm out my loved one, to set you free,

Twisted and listed, on the run every night,
The Master Psycho's got victims in sight,
With a butcherknife and a smile on my face,
I'm the Michael Myers from outer space,
